7.1) 
    ts = Seek Time meaning the ammount of tiem it takes for the movable-head system to move at the track.
    r  = The Rotation Speed of the disk, in revolutions per second allowing the movable head to be over the desired block/segment.
    b/rN = The rate at which the movable head is able to access all of the bits on the track

7.3) 
    ts = seek time; average time to position head over track  
    r = rotation speed of the disk, in revolutions per second  
    n = number of bits per sector  
    N = capacity of a track, in bits 
    Tsector = time to access(read or write) a sector
    
    Tsector = ts + 1/(2r) + n/(rN)

7.4) Consider a magnetic disk drive with 8 surfaces, 512 tracks per surface, and 64 sectors 
per track. Sector size is 1 kB. The average seek time is 8 ms, the track-to-track access time is 1.5 
ms, and the drive rotates at 3600 rpm. Successive tracks in a cylinder can be read without head 
movement.

    a) What is the disk capacity?
        8 * 512 * 64 * 1kb = 256 mb
    
    b) What is the average access time? Assume this file is stored in successive sectors and tracks of  
       successive cylinders, starting at sector 0, track 0, of cylinder i.

        Average Seek = 8ms
        Rotational Speed = 3600 rpm
        Sectors = 64

        Rotational Latancy = 1/2 * 1/60 = 8.3ms

        Transfer Time per sector= 3600rpm * 1kb / 64 * 65536 = 3,686,400/4,194,304 bytes per second = 0.87890625 bytes per second = 1136.36ms

        Average Access time = 8ms + 8.333ms + 1136.36ms = 1152.693ms

    c) Estimate the time required to transfer a 5-MB file.

        5Mb = 5 * 1024 * 1024 bytes = 5,242,880 bytes

        5,242,880/ 0.87890625 bytes per second = 5,959,536.64second = 1655.43 hours 

    d) What is the burst transfer rate?

        Burst rate = 60 * 64 * 65,536 = 240mb/s


7.5) Consider a single-platter disk with the following parameters: rotation speed: 7200 
rpm; number of tracks on one side of platter: 30,000; number of sectors per track: 600; seek time: 
one ms for every hundred tracks traversed. Let the disk receive a request to access a random 
sector on a random track and assume the disk head starts at track 0.

    a) What is the average seek time?

        seek time = 1revolution/120 rps + 30,000/100 * 1ms 
                  = 0.0083sec + 300ms 
                  = 0.3083 seconds 
    
    b) What is the average rotational latency?

        Rotational latency = 1/2 * 1/120
                           = 1/240 seconds = 4.166ms

    c)  What is the transfer time for a sector? !!!what is the size of the sector!!!
