7.1) 
    ts = Seek Time meaning the ammount of tiem it takes for the movable-head system to move at the track.
    r  = The Rotation Speed of the disk, in revolutions per second allowing the movable head to be over the desired block/segment.
    b/rN = The rate at which the movable head is able to access all of the bits on the track

7.3) 
    ts = seek time; average time to position head over track  
    r = rotation speed of the disk, in revolutions per second  
    n = number of bits per sector  
    N = capacity of a track, in bits 
    Tsector = time to access(read or write) a sector
    
    Tsector = ts + 1/(2r) + n/(rN)

7.4) Consider a magnetic disk drive with 8 surfaces, 512 tracks per surface, and 64 sectors 
per track. Sector size is 1 kB. The average seek time is 8 ms, the track-to-track access time is 1.5 
ms, and the drive rotates at 3600 rpm. Successive tracks in a cylinder can be read without head 
movement.

    a) What is the disk capacity?
        8 * 512 * 64 * 1kb = 256 mb
    
    b) What is the average access time? Assume this file is stored in successive sectors and tracks of  
       successive cylinders, starting at sector 0, track 0, of cylinder i.

        Average Seek = 8ms
        Rotational Speed = 3600 rpm
        Sectors = 64

        Rotational Latancy = 1/2 * 1/60 = 8.3ms

        Transfer Time per sector= 3600rpm * 1kb / 64 * 65536 = 3,686,400/4,194,304 bytes per second = 0.87890625 bytes per second = 1136.36ms

        Average Access time = 8ms + 8.333ms + 1136.36ms = 1152.693ms

    c) Estimate the time required to transfer a 5-MB file.

        5Mb = 5 * 1024 * 1024 bytes = 5,242,880 bytes

        5,242,880/ 0.87890625 bytes per second = 5,959,536.64second = 1655.43 hours 

    d) What is the burst transfer rate?

        Burst rate = 60 * 64 * 65,536 = 240mb/s


7.5) Consider a single-platter disk with the following parameters: rotation speed: 7200 
rpm; number of tracks on one side of platter: 30,000; number of sectors per track: 600; seek time: 
one ms for every hundred tracks traversed. Let the disk receive a request to access a random 
sector on a random track and assume the disk head starts at track 0.

    a) What is the average seek time?

        seek time = 1revolution/120 rps + 30,000/100 * 1ms 
                  = 0.0083sec + 300ms 
                  = 0.3083 seconds 
    
    b) What is the average rotational latency?

        Rotational latency = 1/2 * 1/7200 rpm * 1/60
                           = 1/240 seconds = 4.166ms

    c)  What is the transfer time for a sector? !!!what is the size of the sector!!!

        tT = 1 sector / ( 7200rps / 60sec * 600 sectors ) = 0.013888ms

    d) What is the total average time to satisfy a request?

        tb = 308.3 + 4.166ms + 0.013888ms 
           = 312.479888ms

7.9) Consider a 4-drive, 200 GB-per-drive RAID array. What is the available data storage 
capacity for each of the RAID levels 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6?

    Raid lvl 0) 
        there is no redundants so all 4 drives will be using all 200gb totaling to 
        200gb * 4 = 800gb available

    Raid lvl 1) 
        each drive will be using double the storage so each drive will have only 100gb available so
        100gb * 4 = 400gb available

    Raid lvl 2)
        per m being proportional to log(N) there is one disked used up for redundants so 
        200gb * 3 = 600gb available

    Raid lvl 3) 
        one drive will be used for redundants so 
        200gb * 3 = 600gb available

    Raid lvl 4)
        same as Raid 4 
        200gb * 3 = 600gb available

    Raid lvl 5) 
        same as Raid 4 and 3 but striped over drives
        200gb * 3 = 600gb

    Raid lvl 6) 
        Similar striping as raid 5 but there are copies so it uses 2 drives total
        200gb * 2 = 400gb

7.11) Design a backup strategy for a computer system. One option is to use plug-in external 
disks, which cost $150 for each 500 GB drive. Another option is to buy a tape drive for $2500, 
and 400 GB tapes for $50 apiece. (These were realistic prices in 2008.) A typical backup strategy 
is to have two sets of backup media onsite, with backups alternately written on them so in case 
the system fails while making a backup, the previous version is still intact. Thereâ€™s also a third set 
kept offsite, with the offsite set periodically swapped with an on-site set. 

    a) Assume you have 1 TB (1000 GB) of data to back up. How much would a disk backup system cost?
        if your doing a Raid lvl 1 then it would cost $300 for two 500gb drives

    b) How much would a tape backup system cost for 1 TB? 
        starting with the tape drive and 3 400gb taps for a RAID lvl 1 the total will be 
        2500 + 50 * 3 = $2650
         
    c) How large would each backup have to be in order for a tape strategy to be less expensive? 
         150x = 50x + 2500  
         x = 25
         25 * 400gb(per tape) = 10,000gb 
         = 10tb

    d) What kind of backup strategy favors tapes?
         RAID lvl 3 because it uses the least number of tapes to store the most amount of data along with 
         having parallel access.
