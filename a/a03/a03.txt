    a)
        they are filling an array z with the difference between array x and array y at the same index 
        then Squaring all the elements in the z array 
    b)
        Program A will be better because since z[i] is already being called within the scope 
        and so is only needing to compute the address one compared to Program B where z[i] is getting computed twice.

4.3)
    a)
        with reference to the first for loop each time that it iterates the system will need to compute the address of a[i]
    b)
        the example of temporal locality would be in reference within the second loop where it is both reading and writing on a[i] and so as the loop iterates it will hold onto a[i].

4.5)
        1 + 0.05T > 1.5 +0.03T
        0.05T - 0.03T > 1.5 - 1
        t(0.05 - 0.03) > 0.5
        0.02T > 0.5
        T > 0.5/0.02
        T > 25
